): Discuss the strengths and limitations of NPV as capital budgeting methods.

NPV
The NPV as a technique of evaluation of capital budgeting proposals helps a finance manager. If the firm invests its funds in those proposals whose NPV is either 0 or negative, then the proposal is not going to contribute anything to the wealth of the shareholders. Rather, it may even decrease the wealth. As the present value depends on both timing and the rate of discount, a positive NPV indicates that over its economic life, the cash flows generated by the investment will recover the original outlay, earn the desired return, and in addition provide a cushion of excess value. 
Conversely, a negative NPV indicates that the project is not achieving the rate of return and will this cause a loss. Obviously, the rate of return, the timing of the cash flows and the relative magnitude of cash flows will all affect the NPV. The merits of the NPV technique can be enumerated as follows:
(a)	The first and the foremost merit of the NPV technique is that it recognizes the time value of money. It helps evaluation of proposals involving cash flows over a period of several years.
(b)	The NPV technique considers the entire cash flow stream and all the cash inflows and outflows, irrespective of the timing of their occurrence, are incorporated in the calculation of the NPV.
(c)	The NPV technique is based on the cash flows rather than the accounting profit and thus helps in analysing the effect of the proposal on the wealth of the shareholders in a better way.
(d)	The discount rate, k, applied for discounting the future cash flows is in fact, the minimum required rate of return which incorporates both the pure return as well as the premium required to set off the risk.
(e)	The NPV technique represents the net contribution of a proposal towards the wealth of the firm and is therefore, in full conformity with the objective of maximization of the wealth of the shareholders.
The above merits of the NPV technique make it a popular technique of evaluation of capital budgeting proposals. The very fact that this technique is capable of evaluating the proposals that are profit seeking and involve cash flows over a period of several years makes it a preferred technique of evaluation of capital budgeting proposals. But this does not mean that it is free from shortcomings. The NPV technique has the following shortcomings.
(a)	It involves difficult calculations. Moreover, it may not be able to overcome the uncertainty involve with cash flows occurring after a sizeable time gap. It fails to answer questions such as: How to quantify the potential error inherent in the cash flow estimates, and how does the measure help make investment choices if such errors are significant?
(b)	The NPV technique requires the predetermination of the required rate of return, k, which itself is a difficult job. If the value of the ‘k’ is not correctly taken, then the whole exercise of the NPV may give wrong results,
(c)	The NPV technique does not provide a measure of project’s own rate of return, rather it evaluates a proposal against an external variable i.e. the minimum required rate of return,
(d)	The decision under the NPV technique is based on a value which is an absolute measure. It ignores the difference in initial outflows, size of different proposals etc. while evaluating mutually exclusive proposals. 
IRR
The IRR technique is the other important discounted cash flow technique of evaluation of capital budgeting proposals after the NPV technique. However, the merits of the IRR technique can be summarized as follows:
(a)	The IRR technique takes into account the time value of money and the cash flows occurring at different point of time are adjusted for time value of money to make them comparable,
(b)	It is a profit-oriented concept and helps selecting those proposals which are expected to earn more than the minimum required rate of return. This minimum required rate of return is the cost of capital of the firm. So, the IRR technique helps achieving the objective of maximization of shareholders wealth.
(c)	The IRR of a proposal is expressed as a percentage and is compared with the cut-off rate which is also expressed as a percentage. Thus, the IRR has an appeal for those who want to analyse a proposal in terms of its percentage return,
(d)	Like NPV technique, the IRR technique is also based on the consideration of all the cash flows occurring at any time. The salvage value, the working capital used and released etc. are also considered,
(e)	The IRR technique is based on the cash flows rather than the accounting profit.
